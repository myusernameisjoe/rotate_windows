Step 3: Provide Necessary Permissions
Open "System Preferences" > "Security & Privacy".
Go to the "Privacy" tab.
Select "Accessibility" from the sidebar.
Click the lock icon at the bottom left to make changes (you may need to enter your password).
Click the "+" button and add Terminal or the IDE you are using to run Python scripts.
Ensure Python is also given accessibility permissions if it appears in the list.
Step 4: Create an Automator Service to Run the Script
Open Automator (you can find it in your Applications folder).
Choose "Quick Action".
Set "Workflow receives" to "no input" in "any application".
Drag "Run Shell Script" from the left pane to the workflow on the right.
Set "Pass input" to "as arguments".
In the text box, enter the following command (make sure the path to your script is correct):
bash
Copy code
/usr/local/bin/python3 /path/to/your/rotate_windows.py
Save the quick action with a meaningful name, like "RotateWindows".
Step 5: Bind the Quick Action to a Shortcut
Open "System Preferences" > "Keyboard".
Go to the "Shortcuts" tab.
Select "Services" from the sidebar and find "RotateWindows" under "General".
Add a shortcut by double-clicking none and pressing F6.
Step 6: Testing
Press F6 in any application to see if the windows rotate as expected across your displays.
